# Ill-make-a-man-out-of-you.
This is part of the lyrics from a popular song that comes from Mulan. The song is called Ill make a man out of you by Danny Osmond.

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win

You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you
I'm never gonna catch my breath!
Say goodbye to those who knew me!
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym?
This guy got 'em scared to death!
Hope he doesn't see right through me!
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!
